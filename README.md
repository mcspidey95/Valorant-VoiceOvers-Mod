# Valorant-VoiceOvers-Mod
A tool to run Valorant with Japanese or English Voice-overs while retaining English Text/UI.

# **STEPS**

1. Go to Riot Client, Settings icon, Settings, Set Valorant's Language to Japanese (Right below Italiano).
2. Close Riot Client.
3. Download the Mod from my Github and extract it.
4. Place the extracted folder into Documents Folder. (Don't Place it anywhere else, only in C:\Documents).
5. Place the Shortcuts given in the folder where ever you like.
6. Open Blue Shortcut for Japanese Mode | Red Shortcut for English Mode.




# **PRECAUTIONS**

While switching from Japanese to English, or vice-versa. You will need to restart the game again to fix it (It will say, update patch and wont let you play).

Do not open the game manually through original shortcut or by using search or riot client, **USE GIVEN SHORTCUTS ONLY**.
